SPELL CHECKER EXPERIMENT RESULTS
=================================

Experiment: Two-word misspelling correction
Query: "sles reprt"
Result: "sales report"

PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------
Total execution time: 1.182 seconds
Total function calls: 3,491,725

Performance breakdown:
- Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm: 0.702s (59% of total)
  * Called 65,482 times
  * 0.921s cumulative time

- Correction suggestion: 0.019s per word
  * Called 2 times (once per misspelled word)
  * 0.941s cumulative time per word

- Dictionary creation: 0.224s
  * 0.112s per word

CONSIDERATIONS
--------------
1. BOTTLENECK: Damerau-Levenshtein distance calculation is the primary performance bottleneck
   - Accounts for ~60% of total execution time
   - Called 65k+ times for just 2 words
   - Suggests inefficient candidate generation or lack of early filtering

2. OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Implement candidate pre-filtering before distance calculation
   - Add length-based filtering (reject candidates with length diff > 2)
   - Cache distance calculations for repeated comparisons

3. ACCURACY: Correction quality is good (sles→sales, reprt→report)

4. SCALABILITY CONCERN: Linear increase in function calls suggests O(n) or worse complexity
   - Need to benchmark with longer queries to confirm scaling behavior

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
-------------------
Priority 1: Reduce Damerau-Levenshtein calls by 80-90%
Priority 2: Implement candidate filtering strategy
Priority 3: Add performance benchmarks for varying query lengths
Priority 4: Consider alternative algorithms for initial filtering

=================================

Experiment #2: Two-word misspelling correction (After code review)
Query: "sles reprt"
Result: "sales report"

PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------
Total execution time: 0.577 seconds
Total function calls: 1,319,155

Performance breakdown:
- Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm: 0.222s (38% of total)
  * Called 28,022 times
  * 0.292s cumulative time

- Correction suggestion: 0.012s per word
  * Called 2 times (once per misspelled word)
  * 0.327s cumulative time total

- Dictionary creation: 0.023s
  * 0.012s per word

IMPROVEMENTS OBSERVED
---------------------
1. PERFORMANCE GAIN: 51% reduction in total execution time (1.182s → 0.577s)
   - Total function calls reduced by 62% (3.5M → 1.3M)

2. ALGORITHM EFFICIENCY: Damerau-Levenshtein calls reduced by 57% (65,482 → 28,022)
   - Per-call time improved from 0.011ms to 0.008ms
   - Cumulative time reduced by 68% (0.921s → 0.292s)

3. CORRECTION SPEED: Suggestion time per word improved by 37% (0.019s → 0.012s)

4. DICTIONARY LOADING: Improved by 90% (0.224s → 0.023s)
   - Likely due to caching or system optimizations

CONSIDERATIONS
--------------
1. Still room for optimization - 28k distance calculations for 2 words is high
2. Length-based filtering could further reduce unnecessary calculations
3. Accuracy remains good (sles→sales, reprt→report)
4. The improvement suggests some optimization occurred between runs

NEXT STEPS
----------
- Implement length-based candidate filtering (as per config)
- Add early termination in distance calculation
- Test with longer queries to verify scaling
